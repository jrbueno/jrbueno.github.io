First blog post using [jekyll][jekyll], and I've to admit is pretty awesome.

Going forward I plan to document my adventures in learning new languages, frameworks,etc. After reading ["the Passionate Programmer"][passionateprog] 
by Chad Fowler, i've rekindled my desire to improve my craft after several years of being simply content with it.

Recently, I completed a MOOC on [programming languages][proglang] which introduce me to sml, racket and ruby. Ruby has always being in my list 
of languages to learn and never had time to get into it. I enjoyed it very much and that has giving me the jumpstart to go for it. 

So this will be the place for me to showcase my learning experience.
